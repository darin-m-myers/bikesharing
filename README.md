# NYC citiBike Riders
bikesharing in Tableau

## Overview
The purpose of the analysis is to determine the breakdown of demographics for a current bikesharing program in NYC. This will help in determining a strategy for implementing a new bikesharing program in Des Moines.

## Results
### 1. Peak Hours
The majority of riders are during the hours of 5 and 6 PM.

### 2. Checkout Times for Users
Most checkout times are around 5.6 minutes long.

### 3. Gender Breakdown
About 75% of the riders are male.

### 4. Checkout Times by Gender
The male representation is easy to see here as well. But an interesting thing to note is that Female riders have a higher peak of checkout at 6 minutes, and for those that did not specify their gender, the peak is 11 minutes, but the entire line is much flatter.

### 5. Trips by Weekday per Hour
It is apparent that the 5 & 6 hour times are the heavyest times, especially on Thursday and a little lesser on Monday and Tuesday. Also the 8 AM hour has a bit of a peak as well.

### 6. Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)
In general the same patterns show up here as well. Higher values among males and the 8AM, 5PM and 6 PM times on Mon, Tue, and Thursday are the highest usage.

### 7. Trips by Gender by Weekday
There is very little difference in the genders when you look at the customer data. There are signifigantly more riders that are subscribers, so the pattern noticed previously in Males on Thursday is apparent within that group.

## Summary
The main takaways from these visualizations is that bikesharing is much more popular in the male population and that the vast majority of the riders are subscribers. They tend to use it in the morning and evening suggesting that many use the bikes for commuting. 

### Additional Visualizations
1. It would be interesting to compare the gender breakdowns to the general population to determine if males are over represented in this sample. 

This could lead to some surveying of the population to see what is preventing adoption of      ridesharing in the Female population. One hypothesis would be concerning how safe the riders feel using the bikes and how safe they feel picking up the bikes at the bikesharing locations.

2. Overlaying a map with the popular locations by Gender may point out some areas that the female population tends to avoid.

This would help to determine if certain locations have better safety or appeal and these attributes could be more widely adopted in the new ridesharing program.
